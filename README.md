# NPTEL Assignment Calculator 
Recently, I took an NPTEL exam and encountered difficulty in calculating my internal marks based on assignments. To address this, I decided to create a website that calculates internal marks for any NPTEL exam. The website works by first obtaining the course's duration in weeks and then collecting the assignment marks for each week to calculate the internal marks based on NPTEL's criteria.

After completing the website, I encountered three main issues:

1. Incomplete marks or unentered assignment marks: Displaying a pop-up message to prompt the user to enter all assignment marks before calculating the internal marks.

2. Negative values: Implementing input validation to reject negative values, displaying an error message if one is entered.

3. Out-of-range marks: Checking that marks fall within the acceptable range and displaying an error message if they do not.

The website's output displays in green if the user has passed the internal and in red if they have failed, providing the user with their internal marks.
